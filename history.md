## Beta

## Alpha

10. Review feedback from alpha
21 October 2016

Updated register released to beta.

6 October 2016

A workshop was held between Stephen McAllister and GDS to review the feedback received on the alpha register and to ensure any necessary changes were made to the register before it was released to alpha.

Stephen confirmed that the register should not contain information about each local authority’s website as it is not his responsibility to oversee their creation or amendment. Instead, GDS are working with the custodian of the register of government domains where this information will be accurately maintained.

For the official-name field, Stephen and GDS checked the name specified in the constitutions of all English local authorities and compared the frequency of its appearance in legislation with that of the official-name field that existed in the seed data that went into the alpha register. The decision was taken that the name that appeared most in legislation would constitute the official-name.

Stephen also confirmed that where ISO codes exist for local authorities, they should be retained and only where they did not already exist would Stephen provide new codes in the same format to serve as the unique identifiers.

Contrary to feedback received from a number of users, Stephen clarified that no hierarchy exists between local authorities and so the register could not contain any sort of information around relationships between different authorities.

Similarly, what are now referred to as ceremonial or historic counties no longer exist and so will not be included in the register.

Finally, the register does not contain boundary data or geospatial information about local authorities because DCLG is not the authority for this. There will, however, likely be a local-authority-boundary-eng register which will provide this data and be maintained by the relevant custodian.
Alpha9. Find duplicate lists

July 2016

Reviewed existing duplicate local authority lists. There are 9 duplicate local authority lists published by 8 different organisations.
Alpha8. Meet technical standards

18 August 2016

The local authority England register will be hosted on the Open Register platform and so conforms to the technical standards.
Alpha7. Meet operational standards

10 October 2016

The local authority England register will be hosted on the Open Register platform and so conforms to the operational standards.
Discovery6. Review how register is updated

27 July 2016

Stephen McAllister is continuing to define the DCLG’s new process for updating the register. For the alpha register, updates will be made in conjunction with GDS.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected

27 July 2016

GDS and DCLG agreed to add an email link to each page of the local authority England register. All feedback is sent to the registers team at GDS. Who replies will depend on if the feedback is about the product or the data.
Discovery4. Agree dataset

15 August 2016

Initial dataset provided by DCLG and loaded into the alpha register.

27 July 2016

DCLG and GDS agreed revisions to the fields for the local authority England register. They are:

* local-authority (ISO 3166-1)
* local-authority-type (the type of local authority)
* name (approved British English-language name)
* official-name (official name of the local authority)
* website (the URL of the local authority’s website)
* start-date (first date this entry became applicable)
* end-date (last date this entry was applicable)

They agreed not to include:

* uk (the country the local authority resides in)
* parent-local-authority (the type of local authority)
* name -cy (approved Welsh-language name)

The ‘uk’ and ‘name-cy’ fields aren’t needed as the register only contains local authorities in England.

The ‘parent-local-authority’ field isn’t necessary as no parent-child relationship exists between different types of local authorities.

## Discovery
3. Agree a custodian
7 July 2016

Stephen Aldridge, data leader for DCLG, suggested Stephen McAllister should be the custodian of the local authority register. Stephen McAllister accepted the offer.

Workshop with Stephen Aldridge, Steve Peters, Stephen McAllister and GDS to review progress and discuss how to bring the local authority register into discovery.

Within the workshop, it was clarified that DCLG has a mandate to manage a relationship with local authorities in England. It was decided the register should only contain information about English local authorities to reflect that.

The fields proposed for the register were:

* local-authority (ISO 3166-1 plus alpha 2 code for the local authority, plus the SNAC code for subsidiary authorities)
* uk (the country the local authority resides in)
* local-authority-type (the type of local authority)
* parent-local-authority (the type of local authority)
* name (approved British English-language name)
* name-cy (approved Welsh-language name)
* official-name (official name of the local authority)
* website (the URL of the local authority’s website)
* start-date (the date the local authority was created)
* end-date (last date this entry was applicable)

Separately, GDS will explore the possibility of registers of local authorities in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Backlog2. Register is accepted

April 2016

Local authority register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.

DCLG was accepted by GDS as the registry of the local authority register.

This is because DCLG maintains the relationship with the various local authorities within the UK.
Backlog1. Request a register

March 2016

Local authority register was proposed by Steve Peters, Open Data Strategist for the DCLG, and Paul Downey from the registers team at GDS.
